After 118 mins, I rolled my eyes, sank my head into my arms, had some water and switched my attention to Ulaa Selim, who's brainchild is this heavy one – ‘Danmarks Sonner’ .

Sons of Denmark is the new face of ‘La Haine’. The movie is set in 2025, the near future,

So it starts with a bang, a blast [which was essential ,
 I think to draw my entire attention and fix it there for a couple of dark and heavy hours.] in the capital,
 taking lives of 23 innocents, which  triggered the known demon of this Danish society,
 where migrated Muslim and Danish origin people are living in a fragile harmony. 
The narrative structure of the movie really amazes me as it is telling the stories of the two protagonists in two halves of the movie 
and always kept the viewer guessing about who’s side of story is to be told.
